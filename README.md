## About 

Solobot is a bot made for [Solonodes](https://discord.gg/solonodes-redefining-the-techniques-of-hosting-839742744099422208). The bot as of now is meant for verification purposes.
## Usage

Download the bot as zip file.<br/>
After downloading it, simply edit its config.json file to change the verify role. Use a valid role id, as not using it will make the bot throw errors.<br/>
Once, that is done, simply enter the bot token from discord developer portal in the .env file at the token field.<br/>

And, done, save the files, and run the main.py file.
